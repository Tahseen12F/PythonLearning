# Write a program to calculate the area of Circle given its radius  using formula area = pie * r * 2 (Take pie = 3.16)
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of Circle : "))
PIE = 3.14
area = (PIE * radius * 2)
print("Area of Circle is : ", area)

# Create a program that takes two numbers as input
# and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

print("First number is equal to Second number", a == b)
print("First number is less than Second number", a < b)
print("First number is greater Second number", a > b)

# Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number.
x = int(input("Enter the number :"))
